Original text:
From fairest creatures we desire increase,
That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
But as the riper should by time decease,
His tender heir might bear his memory:
But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,
Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,
Making a famine where abundance lies,
Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament
And only herald to the gaudy spring,
Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
And, tender churl, mak'st waste in niggarding:
Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.
When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,
Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now
Will be a tottered weed of small worth held:
Then being asked where all thy beauty lies,
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,
To say within thine own deep-sunken eyes
Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.
How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,
If thou couldst answer, 'This fair child of mine
Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse',
Proving his beauty by succession thine.
This were to be new made when thou art old,
And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.
Look in thy glass* and tell the face thou viewest,
Now is the time that face should form another,
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother**.
For where is she so fair whose uneared womb
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
Or who is he so fond*** will be the tomb
Of his self-love to stop posterity?
Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee
Calls back the lovely April of her prime;
So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,
Despite of wrinkles, this thy golden time.
But if thou live rememb'red not to be,
Die single, and thine image dies with thee.
Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend
Upon thyself thy beauty's legacy?
Nature's bequest gives nothing, but doth lend,
And being frank she lends to those are free:
Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse
The bounteous largess given thee to give?
Profitless usurer, why dost thou use
So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?
For having traffic with thyself alone,
Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive:
Then how, when Nature calls thee to be gone,
What cceptable audit canst thou leave?
Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,
Which usd lives th'executor to be.
Those hours that with gentle work did frame
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
Will play the tyrants to the very same,
And that unfair which fairly doth excel;
For never-resting time leads summer on
To hideous winter and confounds him there,
Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,
Beauty o'ersnowed and bareness every where:
Then were not summer's distillation left
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,
Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,
Nor it nor no remembrance what it was.
But flowers distilled, though they with winter meet,
Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.
Then let not winter's ragged hand deface
In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled:
Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place
With beauty's treasure ere it be self-killed:
That use is not forbidden usury
Which happies those that pay the willing loan;
That's for thyself to breed another thee,
Or ten times happier be it ten for one;
Ten times thyself were happier than thou art,
If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:
Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,
Leaving thee living in posterity?
Be not self-willed, for thou art much too fair
To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.
Lo in the orient when the gracious light
Lifts up his burning head, each under eye
Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,
Serving with looks his sacred majesty;
And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,
Resembling strong youth in his middle age,
Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,
Attending on his golden pilgrimage:
But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,
Like feeble age he reeleth from the day,
The eyes (fore duteous) now converted are
From his low tract and look another way:
So thou, thyself outgoing in thy noon,
Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son.
Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?
Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:
Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly,
Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?
If the true concord of well-tund sounds,
By unions married, do offend thine ear,
They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds
In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear;
Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;
Resembling sire, and child, and happy mother,
Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing;
Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,
Sings this to thee, 'Thou single wilt prove none.'
Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye
That thou consum'st thyself in single life?
Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die,
The world will wail thee like a makeless wife;
The world will be thy widow and still weep,
That thou no form of thee hast left behind,
When every private widow well may keep,
By children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind:
Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend
Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it,
But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,
And kept unused the user so destroys it:
No love toward others in that bosom sits
That on himself such murd'rous shame commits.
For shame deny that thou bear'st love to any,
Who for thyself art so unprovident.
Grant, if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,
But that thou none lov'st is most evident;
For thou art so possess'd with murd'rous hate,
That 'gainst thyself thou stick'st not to conspire,
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
Which to repair should be thy chief desire:
O change thy thought, that I may change my mind!
Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?
Be as thy presence is, gracious and kind,
Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:
Make thee another self, for love of me,
That beauty still may live in thine or thee.
As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou grow'st
In one of thine, from that which thou departest,
And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st
Thou mayst call thine, when thou from youth convertest:
Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase,
Without this, folly, age, and cold decay:
If all were minded so, the times should cease,
And threescore year would make the world away.
Let those whom Nature hath not made for store,
Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:
Look whom she best endowed she gave the more;
Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:
She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby,
Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.
When I do count the clock that tells the time,
And see the brave day sunk in hideous1 night,
When I behold the violet2 past prime,
And sable3 curls all silvered o'er4 with white,
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,
And summer's green all girded up in sheaves5
Borne on the bier6 with white and bristly beard:
Then of thy beauty do I question make
That thou among the wastes of time must go,
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,
And die as fast as they see others grow,
And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence
Save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence.
O that you were your self! but, love, you are
No longer yours than you yourself here live;
Against this coming end you should prepare,
And your sweet semblance to some other give:
So should that beauty which you hold in lease
Find no determination; then you were
Your self again after yourself's decease,
When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.
Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,
Which husbandry in honour might uphold
Against the stormy gusts of winter's day
And barren rage of death's eternal cold?
O, none but unthrifts: dear my love, you know
You had a father, let your son say so.
Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck,
And yet methinks I have astronomy,
But not to tell of good or evil luck,
Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;
Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,
Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,
Or say with princes if it shall go well
By oft predict that I in heaven find:
But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,
And, constant stars*, in them I read such art
As truth and beauty shall together thrive
If from thy self to store thou wouldst convert:
Or else of thee this I prognosticate,
Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.
Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck,
And yet methinks I have astronomy,
But not to tell of good or evil luck,
Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;
Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,
Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,
Or say with princes if it shall go well
By oft predict that I in heaven find:
But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,
And, constant stars*, in them I read such art
As truth and beauty shall together thrive
If from thy self to store thou wouldst convert:
Or else of thee this I prognosticate,
Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.
When I consider every thing that grows
Holds in perfection but a little moment,
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;
When I perceive that men as plants increase,
Cheerd and checked even by the selfsame sky,
Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
And wear their brave state out of memory:
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,
Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay
To change your day of youth to sullied night,
And all in war with Time for love of you,
As he takes from you, I ingraft you new.
But wherefore do not you a mightier way
Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time,
And fortify yourself in your decay
With means more blessd than my barren rhyme?
Now stand you on the top of happy hours,
And many maiden gardens, yet unset,
With virtuous wish would bear your living flowers,
Much liker than your painted counterfeit:
So should the lines of life that life repair
Which this time's pencil or my pupil pen
Neither in inward worth nor outward fair
Can make you live yourself in eyes of men:
To give away yourself keeps yourself still,
And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill.
Who will believe my verse in time to come
If it were filled with your most high deserts?
Though yet, heaven knows, it is but as a tomb
Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts.
If I could write the beauty of your eyes,
And in fresh numbers number all your graces,
The age to come would say, 'This poet lies;
Such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces.'
So should my papers (yellowed with their age)
Be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,
And your true rights be termed a poet's rage
And stretchd metre of an ntique song:
But were some child of yours alive that time,
You should live twice, in it and in my rhyme.
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
And summer's lease hath all too short a date;
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
By chance or nature's changing course untrimmed:
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,
Nor shall Death brag thou wand'rest in his shade*,
When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st.
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;
Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,
And burn the long-lived phoenix in her blood;
Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet'st,
And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,
To the wide world and all her fading sweets;
But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:
O, carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,
Nor draw no lines there with thine ntique pen;
Him in thy course untainted do allow
For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.
Yet, do thy worst, old Time: despite thy wrong,
My love shall in my verse ever live young.
A woman's face with Nature's own hand painted
Hast thou, the master-mistress of my passion;
A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted
With shifting change, as is false women's fashion;
An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,
Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;
A man in hue, all hues in his controlling,
Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.
And for a woman wert thou first created,
Till Nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,
And by addition me of thee defeated,
By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.
But since she pricked thee out for women's pleasure,
Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.
So is it not with me as with that Muse,
Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse,
Who heaven itself for ornament doth use,
And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,
Making a couplement of proud compare
With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,
With April's first-born flowers, and all things rare
That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.
O let me, true in love, but truly write,
And then believe me, my love is as fair
As any mother's child, though not so bright
As those gold candles fixed in heaven's air:
Let them say more that like of hearsay well,
I will not praise that purpose not to sell.
My glass shall not persuade me I am old,
So long as youth and thou are of one date,
But when in thee time's furrows I behold,
Then look I death my days should expiate:
For all that beauty that doth cover thee
Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,
Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me.
How can I then be elder than thou art?
O therefore, love, be of thyself so wary
As I not for myself but for thee will,
Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary
As tender nurse her babe from faring ill:
Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain;
Thou gav'st me thine, not to give back again.
As an unperfect actor on the stage,
Who with his fear is put besides his part,
Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;
So I, for fear of trust, forget to say
The perfect ceremony of love's rite,
And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,
O'ercharged with burden of mine own love's might:
O let my books be then the eloquence
And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,
Who plead for love, and look for recompense,
More than that tongue that more hath more expressed.
O learn to read what silent love hath writ:
To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.
Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled
Thy beauty's form in table of my heart;
My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,
And prspective it is best painter's art.
For through the painter must you see his skill
To find where your true image pictured lies,
Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,
That hath his windows glazd with thine eyes.
Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:
Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me
Are windows to my breast, wherethrough the sun
Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee.
Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,
They draw but what they see, know not the heart.
Let those who are in favour with their stars
Of public honour and proud titles boast,
Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars,
Unlooked for joy in that I honour most.
Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread
But as the marigold at the sun's eye,
And in themselves their pride lies burid,
For at a frown they in their glory die.
The painful warrior famousd for fight,
After a thousand victories once foiled,
Is from the book of honour rasd quite,
And all the rest forgot for which he toiled:
Then happy I that love and am belovd
Where I may not remove, nor be removd.
Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage
Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,
To thee I send this written ambassage
To witness duty, not to show my wit;
Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine
May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,
But that I hope some good conceit of thine
In thy soul's thought (all naked) will bestow it,
Till whatsoever star that guides my moving
Points on me graciously with fair aspct,
And puts apparel on my tottered loving,
To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:
Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee,
Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.






Direct order:
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,
A man in hue, all hues in his controlling,
A woman's face with Nature's own hand painted
A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted

Against this coming end you should prepare,
Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die,

Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,

Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain;
Profitless usurer, why dost thou use
Proving his beauty by succession thine.
Resembling sire, and child, and happy mother,
Resembling strong youth in his middle age,
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,
Save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence.
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
Serving with looks his sacred majesty;
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?
Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse',
She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby,
Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it,
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,
Sings this to thee, 'Thou single wilt prove none.'
So I, for fear of trust, forget to say
So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?
So is it not with me as with that Muse,
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
So long as youth and thou are of one date,
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
So should my papers (yellowed with their age)
So should that beauty which you hold in lease
So should the lines of life that life repair
So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,
So thou, thyself outgoing in thy noon,
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse,
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;
Such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces.'
Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:
Ten times thyself were happier than thou art,
That 'gainst thyself thou stick'st not to conspire,
That beauty still may live in thine or thee.
That hath his windows glazd with thine eyes.
That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.
That on himself such murd'rous shame commits.
That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
That thou among the wastes of time must go,
That thou consum'st thyself in single life?
That thou no form of thee hast left behind,
That use is not forbidden usury
That's for thyself to breed another thee,
The age to come would say, 'This poet lies;
The bounteous largess given thee to give?
The eyes (fore duteous) now converted are
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
The painful warrior famousd for fight,
The perfect ceremony of love's rite,
The world will be thy widow and still weep,
The world will wail thee like a makeless wife;
Then being asked where all thy beauty lies,
Then happy I that love and am belovd
Then how, when Nature calls thee to be gone,
Then let not winter's ragged hand deface
Then look I death my days should expiate:
Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee,
Then of thy beauty do I question make
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
Then were not summer's distillation left
Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,
Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse
They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds
They draw but what they see, know not the heart.
This were to be new made when thou art old,
Those hours that with gentle work did frame
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother**.
Thou gav'st me thine, not to give back again.
Thou mayst call thine, when thou from youth convertest:
Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive:
Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament
Though yet, heaven knows, it is but as a tomb
Thy beauty's form in table of my heart;
Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.
Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.
Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,
Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,
Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now
Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.
Till Nature as she wrought thee fell a-doting,
Till then, not show my head where thou mayst prove me.
Till whatsoever star that guides my moving
To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.
To change your day of youth to sullied night,
To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.
To find where your true image pictured lies,
To give away yourself keeps yourself still,
To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.
To hideous winter and confounds him there,
To say within thine own deep-sunken eyes
To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:
To the wide world and all her fading sweets;
To thee I send this written ambassage
To witness duty, not to show my wit;
Unlooked for joy in that I honour most.
Unlooked on diest unless thou get a son.
Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend
Upon thyself thy beauty's legacy?
Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.
What cceptable audit canst thou leave?
When I behold the violet2 past prime,
When I consider every thing that grows
When I do count the clock that tells the time,
When I perceive that men as plants increase,
When every private widow well may keep,
When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,
When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st.
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,
When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.
Where I may not remove, nor be removd.
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,
Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;
Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,
Which happies those that pay the willing loan;
Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts.
Which husbandry in honour might uphold
Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,
Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me.
Which steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.
Which this time's pencil or my pupil pen
Which to repair should be thy chief desire:
Which usd lives th'executor to be.
Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars,
Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing;
Who for thyself art so unprovident.
Who heaven itself for ornament doth use,
Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,
Who plead for love, and look for recompense,
Who will believe my verse in time to come
Who with his fear is put besides his part,
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,
Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart;
Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly,
Will be a tottered weed of small worth held:
Will play the tyrants to the very same,
With April's first-born flowers, and all things rare
With beauty's treasure ere it be self-killed:
With means more blessd than my barren rhyme?
With shifting change, as is false women's fashion;
With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,
With virtuous wish would bear your living flowers,
Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
Without this, folly, age, and cold decay:
Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,
Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,
Yet, do thy worst, old Time: despite thy wrong,
You had a father, let your son say so.
You should live twice, in it and in my rhyme.
Your self again after yourself's decease,






Reverse order:
Your self again after yourself's decease,
You should live twice, in it and in my rhyme.
You had a father, let your son say so.
Yet, do thy worst, old Time: despite thy wrong,
Yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,
Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art,
Without this, folly, age, and cold decay:
Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
With virtuous wish would bear your living flowers,
With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,
With shifting change, as is false women's fashion;
With means more blessd than my barren rhyme?

To give away yourself keeps yourself still,

Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.
Thy beauty's form in table of my heart;
Though yet, heaven knows, it is but as a tomb
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament
Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.
Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive:
Thou mayst call thine, when thou from youth convertest:
Thou gav'st me thine, not to give back again.
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother**.
Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
Those hours that with gentle work did frame
This were to be new made when thou art old,
They draw but what they see, know not the heart.
They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds
Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse
Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,
Then were not summer's distillation left
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
Then of thy beauty do I question make
Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee,
Then look I death my days should expiate:
Then let not winter's ragged hand deface
Then how, when Nature calls thee to be gone,
Then happy I that love and am belovd
Then being asked where all thy beauty lies,
The world will wail thee like a makeless wife;
The world will be thy widow and still weep,
The perfect ceremony of love's rite,
The painful warrior famousd for fight,
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell
The eyes (fore duteous) now converted are
The bounteous largess given thee to give?
The age to come would say, 'This poet lies;
That's for thyself to breed another thee,
That use is not forbidden usury
That thou no form of thee hast left behind,
That thou consum'st thyself in single life?
That thou among the wastes of time must go,
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
That on himself such murd'rous shame commits.
That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.
That hath his windows glazd with thine eyes.
That beauty still may live in thine or thee.
That 'gainst thyself thou stick'st not to conspire,
Ten times thyself were happier than thou art,
Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:
Such heavenly touches ne'er touched earthly faces.'
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;
Stirred by a painted beauty to his verse,
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
So thou, thyself outgoing in thy noon,
So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,
So should the lines of life that life repair
So should that beauty which you hold in lease
So should my papers (yellowed with their age)
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
So long as youth and thou are of one date,
So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
So is it not with me as with that Muse,
So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?
So I, for fear of trust, forget to say
Sings this to thee, 'Thou single wilt prove none.'
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,
Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it,
She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby,
Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse',
Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,
Serving with looks his sacred majesty;
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
Save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence.
Sap checked with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
Resembling strong youth in his middle age,
Resembling sire, and child, and happy mother,
Proving his beauty by succession thine.
Profitless usurer, why dost thou use
Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain;
Points on me graciously with fair aspct,
Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,
Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,
Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,
Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
Or who is he so fond*** will be the tomb
Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:
Or ten times happier be it ten for one;
Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
Or say with princes if it shall go well
Or say with princes if it shall go well
Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?
Or else of thee this I prognosticate,
Or else of thee this I prognosticate,
Of public honour and proud titles boast,
Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;
Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;
Of his self-love to stop posterity?
O, none but unthrifts: dear my love, you know
O, carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,
O'ercharged with burden of mine own love's might:
O therefore, love, be of thyself so wary
O that you were your self! but, love, you are
O let my books be then the eloquence
O let me, true in love, but truly write,
O learn to read what silent love hath writ:
O change thy thought, that I may change my mind!
Now stand you on the top of happy hours,
Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:
Now is the time that face should form another,
Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck,
Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck,
Nor shall Death brag thou wand'rest in his shade*,
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st,
Nor it nor no remembrance what it was.
Nor draw no lines there with thine ntique pen;
Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,
Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,
No love toward others in that bosom sits
No longer yours than you yourself here live;
Neither in inward worth nor outward fair
Nature's bequest gives nothing, but doth lend,
My love shall in my verse ever live young.
My glass shall not persuade me I am old,
My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,
Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?
Much liker than your painted counterfeit:
More than that tongue that more hath more expressed.
Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me
Mine eye hath played the painter and hath stelled
Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.
May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,
Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,
Making a famine where abundance lies,
Making a couplement of proud compare
Make war upon this bloody tyrant Time,
Make thee another self, for love of me,
Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place
Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleet'st,
Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage
Look whom she best endowed she gave the more;
Look what an unthrift in the world doth spend
Look in thy glass* and tell the face thou viewest,
Lo in the orient when the gracious light
Like feeble age he reeleth from the day,
Lifts up his burning head, each under eye
Let those whom Nature hath not made for store,
Let those who are in favour with their stars
Let them say more that like of hearsay well,
Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.
Leaving thee living in posterity?
Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye
Is from the book of honour rasd quite,
Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,
In thy soul's thought (all naked) will bestow it,
In thee thy summer ere thou be distilled:
In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear;
In one of thine, from that which thou departest,
If thou couldst answer, 'This fair child of mine
If the true concord of well-tund sounds,
If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:
If it were filled with your most high deserts?
If from thy self to store thou wouldst convert:
If from thy self to store thou wouldst convert:
If all were minded so, the times should cease,
If I could write the beauty of your eyes,
I will not praise that purpose not to sell.
How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,
How can I then be elder than thou art?
Holds in perfection but a little moment,
His tender heir might bear his memory:
Him in thy course untainted do allow
Herein lives wisdom, beauty, and increase,
Hast thou, the master-mistress of my passion;
Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish:
Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread
Grant, if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,
Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;
From his low tract and look another way:
From fairest creatures we desire increase,
For where is she so fair whose uneared womb
For through the painter must you see his skill
For thou art so possess'd with murd'rous hate,
For shame deny that thou bear'st love to any,
For never-resting time leads summer on
For having traffic with thyself alone,
For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.
For at a frown they in their glory die.
For all that beauty that doth cover thee
Find no determination; then you were
Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,
Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine
Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
Die single, and thine image dies with thee.
Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,
Despite of wrinkles, this thy golden time.
Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee.
Cheerd and checked even by the selfsame sky,
Can make you live yourself in eyes of men:
Calls back the lovely April of her prime;
By unions married, do offend thine ear,
By oft predict that I in heaven find:
By oft predict that I in heaven find:
By children's eyes, her husband's shape in mind:
By chance or nature's changing course untrimmed:
By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.
But wherefore do not you a mightier way
But when in thee time's furrows I behold,
But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,
But were some child of yours alive that time,
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,
But that thou none lov'st is most evident;
But that I hope some good conceit of thine
But since she pricked thee out for women's pleasure,
But not to tell of good or evil luck,
But not to tell of good or evil luck,
But if thou live rememb'red not to be,
But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,
But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,
But flowers distilled, though they with winter meet,
But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,
But as the riper should by time decease,
But as the marigold at the sun's eye,
But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:
Borne on the bier6 with white and bristly beard:
Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,
Beauty o'ersnowed and bareness every where:
Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary
Be scorned, like old men of less truth than tongue,
Be not self-willed, for thou art much too fair
Be as thy presence is, gracious and kind,
Attending on his golden pilgrimage:
As truth and beauty shall together thrive
As truth and beauty shall together thrive
As those gold candles fixed in heaven's air:
As tender nurse her babe from faring ill:
As he takes from you, I ingraft you new.
As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou grow'st
As any mother's child, though not so bright
As an unperfect actor on the stage,
As I not for myself but for thee will,
Are windows to my breast, wherethrough the sun
And, tender churl, mak'st waste in niggarding:
And, constant stars*, in them I read such art
And, constant stars*, in them I read such art
And your true rights be termed a poet's rage
And your sweet semblance to some other give:
And you must live drawn by your own sweet skill.
And yet methinks I have astronomy,
And yet methinks I have astronomy,
And wear their brave state out of memory:
And threescore year would make the world away.
And then believe me, my love is as fair
And that unfair which fairly doth excel;
And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestow'st
And summer's lease hath all too short a date;
And summer's green all girded up in sheaves5
And stretchd metre of an ntique song:
And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.
And see the brave day sunk in hideous1 night,
And sable3 curls all silvered o'er4 with white,
And puts apparel on my tottered loving,
And prspective it is best painter's art.
And only herald to the gaudy spring,
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;
And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence
And many maiden gardens, yet unset,
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;
And kept unused the user so destroys it:
And in themselves their pride lies burid,
And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,
And in fresh numbers number all your graces,
And having climbed the steep-up heavenly hill,
And fortify yourself in your decay
And for a woman wert thou first created,
And every fair with his fair doth rehearse,
And every fair from fair sometime declines,
And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,
And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,
And die as fast as they see others grow,
And by addition me of thee defeated,
And burn the long-lived phoenix in her blood;
And being frank she lends to those are free:
And barren rage of death's eternal cold?
And all the rest forgot for which he toiled:
And all in war with Time for love of you,
An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,
Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die,
Against this coming end you should prepare,
Against the stormy gusts of winter's day
After a thousand victories once foiled,
A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted
A woman's face with Nature's own hand painted
A man in hue, all hues in his controlling,
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,
